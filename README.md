### UI Automation & Docker Containerization

This repo extends the previous example of UI automation using Python and Selenium from [https://github.com/airpaio/ui-automation](https://github.com/airpaio/ui-automation). The code accompany's the second in a series of blog posts on monitoring and observability which can be found on [airpa.io](https://airpa.io).

The Python code here is not changed from the previous repo [https://github.com/airpaio/ui-automation](https://github.com/airpaio/ui-automation), but the main difference here is a Dockerfile used to build a Docker image to run the code in.
